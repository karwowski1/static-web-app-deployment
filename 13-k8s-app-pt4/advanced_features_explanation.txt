• Why Argo CD is beneficial for deploying applications

Because it automates application deployment and ensures that the cluster state matches the configuration in the code. If it detects differences, it can correct them immediately (self-healing).
It works as an extension to K8s. GIT (Target State) -> Argo CD (Agent) -> K8s (Actual Live state)

• Why mTLS is valuable in Kubernetes clusters

Mutual encryption of services, not just from one service. This leaves traffic in an “encrypted tunnel.”

• When Argo CD should NOT be used and why

Argo CD works as an extension to K8s. In other cases, such as serverless infrastructure or infrastructure based on virtual machines, Argo CD will not be suitable. 
Argo CD does not replace tools such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

• When mTLS / Service Mesh should NOT be used and why

In projects with simple traffic encryption. Sometimes it is easier to configure TLS directly in the application or use simpler network tools (CNI).
